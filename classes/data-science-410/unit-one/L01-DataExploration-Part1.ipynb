    "# Lesson 1 - Exploration of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an introduction to the methods data scientists use to prepare and explore a data set. Data scientists spend a lot of time manipulating data to clean and prepare it (**data munging**) and to understand the relationships within the variables in the data (**data exploration**). Visualization is a key skill for any data scientist performing these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any type of inference or machine learning on a data set, you should develop an understanding of the relationships in the data set. Skipping this step can lead wasted time from unexpected problems when building models, or in constructing models with poor performance. When starting any data science project, it is a good idea to plan on spending considerable time exploring the data. These exploration steps are often performed in conjunction with data cleaning and preparing, as visualization often highlights problems with data. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lessons are divided into several parts. In each part you will learn how to use the visualization tools available in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summarizing and manipulating data**:\n",
    "  * How large is it?\n",
    "  * What columns are of interest?\n",
    "  * Missing data?\n",
    "  * What are the characteristics of the data derived from summary statistics and counts?\n",
    "- **Overview of Matplotlib, Pandas plotting and Seaborn** is a review of commonly used Python plotting packages. \n",
    "- **Overview of univariate plot types** is a review of creating these basic plots using three Python packages. These plot types allow you to study the distributional properties of the variables in your data set. \n",
    "- **Using Matplotlib methods** reviews ways to add attributes to plots, such as titles and axis labels. "

As a result, a bit of knowledge of Matplotlib will help you set the attributes of plots created with several other packages. An extensive [tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) is available for Matplotlib.\n",
    "- **Pandas plotting:** The [visualization methods for Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html) provides a simple interface for common plot types for data in data frames. As with many other Python plotting libraries Pandas visualization is built on top of Matplotlib. You can use common Matplotlib methods with Pandas visualization. \n",
    "- **Seaborn:** The [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) package provides high-level api for statistical graphics. As with many other Python plotting libraries Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. You can use common Matplotlib methods with Seaborn.  A [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) with useful examples is available for Seaborn.   \n",
    "- **Other packages:** There are a number of other sophisticated and useful Python graphics packages. Unfortunately, we do not have time in this course to cover these packages. The Python [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) package provides a high-level graphics interface based on the grammar of graphics used in the R ggplot2 package.  There are two powerful Python interactive graphics packages which are widely used, [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)."

    "### Box plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots, also known as box and whisker plots, were introduced by John Tukey in 1970. Box plots are another way to visualize the distribution of data values. In this respect, box plots are comparable to histograms, but are quite different in presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A diagram showing the interpretation of a box plot is shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI410/img/BoxPlot.png\" alt=\"box plot with interquartile ranges\">\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance the interpretation of a box plot is a bit intimidating. The box plot is read in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The bold line in the box shows the median of the distribution. \n",
    "2. The upper and lower middle quartiles of the distribution define the upper and lower limits of the box.\n",
    "3. The length of the whiskers is the lesser of +/-2.5 times the inter-quartile range (about 2.7 times the standard deviation) or the most extreme values of the data. \n",
    "4. Outliers are shown by symbols, such as `+` or `*`, beyond the whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots are best used to compare distributions of a variable grouped by another variable. In this case, several box plots can be stacked along an axis. The data are divided using a 'group by' operation, and the box plots for each group are stacked next to each other. In this way, the box plot allows you to display two dimensions of your data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the cell below uses the matplotlib boxplot method. The only argument is the single data vector. Execute the code in the cell below to create a basic box plot of the price of the automobiles."

    "The above plot is quite basic. Most importantly, this plot lacks the annotation required for someone to quickly understand it. At the minimum a title and an axis label are required. Fortunately, adding these attributes to the plot is relatively easy, since matplotlib provides methods to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is another issue with this plot. Notice that the limits of the y axis is $\\{ 5000, 50000 \\}$. The fact that this limit does not include `0` can distort the observer's view of the data. This is particularly the case when making comparisons between variables, of subsets of variables. In general, the vertical axis limit of  plots should include `0`.\n",

    "The basic recipe is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A matplotlib figure object is created. The `figsize` arguments sets the size of the plot area.\n",
    "2. An axis object is created for the figure.\n",
    "3. The box plot is added to the axis object.\n",
    "4. Title text is added to the axis object.\n",

The violin plot shows a pair of symmetric kernel density plots. The violin plot has the advantage, and perhaps disadvantage, of showing more. Like a box plot, the violin plot can be conditioned on a categorical (factor) variable, so distributions of a grouped variable can be compared. \n",
