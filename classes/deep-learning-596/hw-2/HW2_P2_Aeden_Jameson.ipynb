First, we\n","will construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward\n","pass through $D$, calculate the loss ($\\log(D(x))$), then\n","calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\n","a batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this\n","batch through $D$, calculate the loss ($\\log(1-D(G(z)))$),\n","and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\n","gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\n","call a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.\n","\n","**Part 2: Train the Generator**\n","\n","As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\n","minimizing $\\log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\n","As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\n","gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\n","instead wish to maximize $\\log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\n","this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\n","Discriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\n","G’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters\n","with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\n","labels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the\n","$\\log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $\\log(1-x)$\n","part) which is exactly what we want.\n","\n","Finally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\n","epoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to\n","visually track the progress of G’s training.
