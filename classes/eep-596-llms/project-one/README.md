From what I can gather this project with work with python 3.10 at most. I'm not a seasoned Python develop and from what I gather the ecosystem of development tools is very fractured and so the approach below for project management may not be the current community conscensus.

1. First, let's install Python 3.10.
    ```
    brew install python@3.10
    ```

2. Create a Python virutal environment,

    ```
    python3.10 -m venv .venv
    ```

3. Activate the environment,

    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies,

    ```
    pip3.10 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Finally, fire up the app,

    ```
    streamlit run Mini_Project_1_Part_1.py
    ```
